The name "Passion Fruit" comes from the Christian missionaries who encountered the fruit in South America in the 16th century. They believed the plant’s unique flower symbolized the "Passion of Christ", referring to the final period of Jesus' life, including his crucifixion.

Here’s how they interpreted the flower’s parts:

1. The tendrils of the plant represented the whips used during the flagellation of Christ.


2. The ten petals and sepals were seen as the 10 apostles (excluding Judas and Peter, who betrayed and denied Christ, respectively).


3. The corona (the ring of filaments) symbolized the crown of thorns placed on Jesus' head.


4. The five stamens were said to represent the five wounds Jesus suffered on the cross.


5. The three stigma were thought to symbolize the three nails used in the crucifixion.



Because of this symbolism, missionaries named the fruit “passion fruit” after the Passion of Christ. This name has persisted, although in its natural habitat, it's also known by other names.
